# Dynamic Grid

## Introduction

The dynamic grid was developed as part of an internal project, as we could not 
quite find a javascript datagrid to suit our needs. What we were looking for was 
a grid that handles very similar to an Spreadsheet application, but was more 
able to be integrated into the general application flow.

I am now open sourcing it as I hope it is of use to other developers on the web.

## Features

 * Spreadsheet feel
 * Load data via AJAX
 * Paged scrolling (handles easily tens of thousands of lines)
 * Filters and Sorting
 * Editable fields
 * Events on select
 * JQuery UI based
